 * Question 1:
 	Given items with values 1,4,5,7 and corresponding weights of 1,3,4,5.
 	With the total weight of 7, what items can you pick so that you
 	maximize the value?
 */

/*
 * Question 2:
 	Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of 
 	capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack. 
 	In other words, given two integer arrays val[0..n-1] and wt[0..n-1] 
 	which represent values and weights associated with n items respectively. 
 	Also given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity, 
 	find out the maximum value subset of val[] such that sum of the 
 	weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to W. 
 	You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item, 
 	or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property)
